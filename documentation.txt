BASIC SELECTORS
Selecting elements on a web page is at the core of jQuery’s capabilities. Basic selectors enable you to target elements by their HTML tags, classes, and IDs. Here’s a glimpse of how it’s done:
// Select by tag
$(“p”) // Selects all <p> elements
// Select by class
$(“.highlight”) // Selects elements with class “highlight”
// Select by ID
$(“#header”) // Selects the element with ID “header”

ATTRIBUTE SELECTORS
Attribute selectors empower you to target elements based on their attributes and values. This is particularly useful for handling input validation and customization:
// Select by attribute
$(“input[type=’text’]”) // Selects all text input elements
// Select with specific attribute
$(“[data-toggle]”) // Selects elements with “data-toggle” attribute

PSEUDO SELECTORS
Pseudo selectors offer dynamic selection based on element states, such as :hover, :first-child, and :nth-child:
// Select the first <li> element inside <ul>
$(“ul li:first-child”)
// Select odd-numbered <tr> elements in a table
$(“table tr:nth-child(odd)”)

DOM TRAVERSAL
jQuery simplifies the process of navigating the DOM hierarchy, allowing you to traverse through parent, children, and sibling elements with ease:
// Select the parent of an element
$(“#childElement”).parent()
// Select all direct children of an element
$(“ul”).children()
// Select the next sibling of an element
$(“.current”).next()

FILTERING ELEMENTS
Refine your selections by filtering elements that meet specific conditions. This enhances precision in manipulating specific parts of your webpage:
// Filter by even-numbered elements
$(“li”).filter(“:even”)
// Filter by elements containing specific text
$(“p”).filter(“:contains(‘jQuery’)”)

METHOD CHAINING
One of jQuery’s strengths lies in its method chaining, enabling you to combine multiple methods into a single, concise line of code:
// Chain methods to select and manipulate an element
$(“#myElement”).addClass(“highlight”).slideUp(1000);
